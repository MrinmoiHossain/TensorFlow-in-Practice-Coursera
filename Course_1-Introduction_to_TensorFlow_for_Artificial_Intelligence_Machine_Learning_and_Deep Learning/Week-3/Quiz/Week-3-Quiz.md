#### 1. What is a Convolution?
##### Ans: A technique to isolate features in images
#### 2. What is a Pooling?
##### Ans: A technique to reduce the information in an image while maintaining features
#### 3. How do Convolutions improve image recognition?
##### Ans: They isolate features in images
#### 4. After passing a 3x3 filter over a 28x28 image, how big will the output be?
##### Ans: 26x26
#### 5. After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, how big will the output be?
##### Ans: 13x13
#### 6. Applying Convolutions on top of our Deep neural network will make training:
##### Ans: It depends on many factors. It might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!
